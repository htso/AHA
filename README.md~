# Aha: Unsupervised Feature Learning with Single-Layer Networks

This is an R implementation of Adam Coates' paper on unsupervised learning [1]. 
The name Aha is derived from Adam-Honglak-Andrew, the initial of the authors, signifying sort of an epiphany which is what occured to me when I first read this paper. 

#Installation
To install directly from github, open a terminal, type R, then

    devtools::install_github('htso/AHA')

#Platforms
Tested it on Linux (ubuntu 14.04). Should work on Windows and OS X.
