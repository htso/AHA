# Aha: Unsupervised Feature Learning with Single-Layer Networks

This is an R implementation of Adam Coates' paper on unsupervised feature learning [1]. 
Aha is derived from the first initial of the three authors, signifying sort of an epiphany 
which is what occured to me when I first read this paper.
